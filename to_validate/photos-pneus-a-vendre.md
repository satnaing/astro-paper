The ContiSportContact 5P is Continental Tire's Max Performance Summer tire developed for the drivers of some of the world's most prestigious high performance sports cars, coupes and sedans. The ContiSportContact 5P is designed to deliver steering precision, cornering stability and short stopping distances in dry and wet conditions, However, like all summer tires, they are not intended to be driven in near freezing temperatures, through snow or on ice.

The ContiSportContact 5P benefits from a tread compound with Continental's Black Chilli Technology that features an innovative type of racing-grade carbon black to ensure a speedy warm-up along with special grip resins that optimize traction on wet and dry roads. These new carbon blacks and resins blend the rubber's flexibility (important for traction) with the tread's rigidity (important for handling). This compound is molded into an asymmetric tread design featuring a continuous center rib (or multiple ribs in wider sizes, especially those tuned for rear axle only applications) flanked by a large number of small, interlocked tread blocks. Circumferential grooves help water flow through the footprint to resist hydroplaning while the transverse block edges divert water away from the tread blocks to improve wet traction.

The tire's internal structure features a rolling resistance-optimized cap and base tread ("cap" on the outside with the "base" underneath), along with twin steel belts reinforced with spirally wrapped polyamide (a mixture of heat-resistant synthetic aramid fiber and nylon threads) that enhance the ride quality while tuning the contact area's vertical flexibility and lateral rigidity.

Limited sizes of the ContiSportContact 5P are available with Continental's ContiSilent Technology, which involves the manufacturer adhering a layer of sound-absorbing foam to the inner liner of the tire to reduce cabin noise in the vehicle. These sizes are identified on the Specs page and in the search results.
