_Cette page est une sous-section de mon[offre en tant que Consultant](/analyste-daffaires-senior-it/)_.

If you're reading this, it's probably because you want to know more about me. If we ever work together, what can you to expect from me? Am I the best candidate for this opportunity? So here is the deal: let me help you to do the hard work. I guarantee that you will have a clear answer at the end of this essay or else I'm paying for the next coffee round. Deal?

OK, let's do this!

In 20 years, **I have worked in many fields** \- telecom, start-ups, military, retail, administration and entertainment. You can take a look at my [LinkedIn profile](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/pascalnguyendeschenes) for my detailed pedigree. I contributed as a consultant, employee and CEO. I recruited partners for various ventures and I hired freelancers to work on my projects.

From these current and past experiences, I do realize what’s going on in organisations and more specifically, what they are looking for. In the tech and the IT field specifically, the conventional skills between disciplines are slowly fading. The set of soft and hard skills necessary to succeed are broader than ever before. The technical advisor, the business analyst, and the product owner are working together, not for each other.

If you would ask me what I do for a living during a dinner at a common friend's place, I would tell you that I consider myself a **Full Stack IT Architect**. In short, I'm the kind of person that can envision the big picture (think, _the why_), while leading, designing and executing the project (think, _the how_).

## If you expect this from an A player

Just as the [full stack engineers](http://www.laurencegellert.com/2012/08/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/), I have a powerful combination of skills that make me incredibly valuable. It sounds weird to make such a statement, but at 35 years old, I know that I have reached that point in my professional life.

For example, I navigate quickly in the evolving and **shifting technological** landscape. These days, my attention goes toward the micro-services structure and the way applications can live in containers (the [Docker](http://www.docker.com/) open source project). I'm your typical early adopter and I wish you valued this kind of personality. As a Full Stack IT Architect, I speak the design lingo, I mockup design on the fly in Keynote and I know the difference between UI and UX. More important, I know how powerful they are.

It's easy for me to switch between the business requirements and the engineer's realities. I speak **both languages**. I can make sense of algorithms, programming and databases. I understand that scaling the Back-End isn’t the same as scaling the Front-End. While I usually don't go over the code on the application's Back-End, I'm comfortable to go into the HTML5, CSS and the Java Script on the Font-End. I'm know how to leverage API's thru Zapier and how great it is to fork existing projects on GitHub.

**Quick note before we move on**. I hope you don't think I'm a self-absorbed person at this point. True, I'm pitching myself to you the best I can. I don't hide what I can offer to the world. I believe most people are way too shy (or too lazy) to put on paper who they are, what they want to do (and don't want to do), what kind of team they are looking for and so on. Obviously, I'm not one of these persons. While some would say I'm special, I would simply say it's years of observations and hard work that hs come to maturity.

I'm on the latest social apps like Trello, Slack, Git, HackPad, StackOverflow, Disqus, and know how to self-promote. As you can see, I'm a avid **writer**. In fact, I post regularly on this very [blog](/). One of the greatest qualities I have over my counterparts, is the way I use a narrative by telling stories to involve my audience.

I have watched enough three minutes Kickstarter videos and TED talks to know how to pitch and engage every kind of person on Earth. As a "retired" entertainer, it probably helps that for 11 nights, I sang and danced in front of an average crowd of 15,000 people at the Bell Center. It happened when I was part of [Star Académie](https://www.google.ca/search?q=star+acad%C3%A9mie+2003&oq=star+acad%C3%A9mie+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.4951j0j4&sourceid=chrome&espv=2&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8) (the very same concept of American Idol in Québec).

I know one thing for sure. **Attention** is the currency of the age and if you have read up to his point, I hopefully have gotten yours. Please let me continue, there is more I'd like to share with you.

Like most Full Stack IT Architects, I have an insatiable appetite to **learn** new ideas, best practices, ways to be more productive and have happiness in my life. I'm genuinely curious about the world. I like to know how it works, and I want to make my mark on it. I can’t put blinders on once I land a project. I must stay up on developments in my industry and other fields like psychology, management, marketing and start-up accelerators. This is because I know that innovation is found at the boundaries of many disciplines, not by narrowly focusing in one sphere.

I love to read authors like [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/), [Tim Ferriss](http://fourhourworkweek.com/about/), [Brian Clark](http://www.copyblogger.com/author/brian/) and [Tony Robbins](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/events/).

Since much of my work involves slicing through thick ambiguity, I am given to radical clarity. **Here's a funny fact about me**. In certain lifestyle choices, I adopt monolithic, monochromatic wardrobes and functional culinary choices. I do this to spend a minimum of attention on them. Per example, I was pissed to learn that the meal substitute [Soylent](http://www.soylent.me/), didn't deliver to Canada.

Being a Full Stack IT Architect is an exercise in shifting between opposite poles. I'm expected to deeply understand my domain (_the geek stuff_) and at the same time, I'm expected to **collaborate** and work in groups effectively (_the emotional intelligence stuff_).

As most communications are not face to face these days, I found Slack being the clear winner as the collaborative business communications tool. It integrates with everything, opposite Microsoft’s latter-day strategy of privileging its own platform over all others. The takeaway here is that, if you haven’t integrated with everyone else’s API, you’re behind. I hope that your business is taking advantage of API's (or at least thinking about it) over repetitive custom development.

I like to stay informed about what everyone else is doing without micromanaging them. I know I'm expected to **trade my hat** from time to time to other roles like: product manager, designer, communicator, strategist, advertiser, consultant, technologist, user advocate, marketer and so on!

Finally, I carry a deep personal responsibility for the company’s success, which is not limited to projects I'm working on. I'm invested in the entire team’s success. Humans refer this manner as « **caring** ».

## What does it means for you

Despite the challenges and the energy it takes to be a Full Stack IT Architect, I expect to live with its benefits. For one, I want some freedom to work the way I want, where I want, and when I want. Of course, everything is open for negotiation, but I won't feel sorry for expecting latitude. It's a fact that I don't fit the typical RH sheet requirements. But... I'm sure you'll find a space in the "Other remarks" section to describe my persona type :)

1. Are you set up to successfully attract and retain a person like me?
2. Have you defined the style of work that is suited for your team?

3. How do you support remote work?

4. Do you provide flexible work hours, or support for alternative scheduling options?

5. Do you support health and wellness or family time?

This leaves us to **one simple question** : Do you trust me? Do you believe that me, Pascal Andy, can ship and deliver my promise? If your heart is telling you I can, [please let me know](/rester-en-contact/).

## tl;dr (too long; didn't read)

**► WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM ME**

1. Labeled me as [The Bridge Maker](/i-am-the-bridge-maker/)
2. Trustworthy and reliable

3. Insatiable learner

4. Great communicator

5. Early adopter _(therefore, I stay up to date and embrace change)_

**► WHAT I EXPECT FROM YOU**

1. To put me in the driver's seat
2. Present me with challenges _(I'm not looking for a job)_

3. Share me a clear vision to believe in

4. Give me continuous feedback _(start, stop, continue to do)_

5. Reward great work _(because I'm a human and I love to know what I do is meaningful)_

Editor's note - I've been so highly shocked by [Chris Messina's article](https://medium.com/@chrismessina/the-full-stack-employee-ed0db089f0a1) when I first read it. It was like this guy has spied on me for the last 5 years. I finally decided to make a personal version of it.
