## What is this?

[Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/configuration/backends/docker/) is a powerful layer 7 reverse-proxy. Once running, the proxy will give you access to 8 different webapps. I think this is a solid use-case to understand how to run this reverse-proxy.

## General consideration

One of my goal here is to create the quickest demo available around the Docker ecosystem.

To accomplish this, we put together the power of:

- **play-with-docker** (#pwg)
- **docker stacks**
- **docker Swarm mode**

I hope the community will use this repo as a base project to demo other stuff like CMS, Log, Monitoring, storage, benchmark and other cool applications we love to use in Docker. At the very moment, I’m trying to see if the [tink stack](https://github.com/influxdata/TICK-docker/issues/20) can work for my needs.

## See the demo

## Project source

Original post on my blog > **GHOST_URL** /traefik-demo-docker-stack-and-play-with-docker/ and the [Github repo](https://github.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this).

## Something looks weird? Please let me know

I consider this README crystal clear. If there is anything that I could improve, please let me know via an issue.

## Traefik version

Find it [here](https://github.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this/blob/master/traefik-manager/toolproxy.yml#L12)

## Ready. Go!

1. Go to <http://labs.play-with-docker.com/>
2. Create **1 instance** and wait for for the node to provision

3. On **node1** , copy-paste:

[code]
# Create Swarm
docker swarm init --advertise-addr eth0

# List nodes
docker node ls

# Install common apps
apk update && apk upgrade && apk add nano curl bash git wget unzip ca-certificates

# Clone repo
cd /root

git clone https://github.com/pascalandy/docker-stack-this.git

cd docker-stack-this/traefik-manager

# If you prefer to use a branch...
# git checkout 1.05; sleep 1;

# Needed to mount the volume
mkdir -p /mnt/DeployGRP/tooldata/traefik/

touch /mnt/DeployGRP/tooldata/traefik/acme.json

chmod 600 /mnt/DeployGRP/tooldata/traefik/acme.json

# Launch all services
./_up

[/code]

## Confirm Traefik is working

1. `docker service ls` is refreshing automatically for about 12 sec.

2. After a while (about 20 sec) we see the logs from Traefik. Do `CTRL-C` and return to terminal’s prompt.

3. Click on `8080` to see **Traefik dashboard**. We see all the services that run behind traefik.

4. Click on `80` and at the end of the URL generate by play-with-ghost, add `/who1` or `/who2` or `/who3` or `/who4`

[code]
# home, the IP is probably different in you #pwg session
http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/

http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/who1

http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/who2

http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/who3

http://pwd10-0-7-3-80.host1.labs.play-with-docker.com/who4

[/code]

#### Web apps details:

- **who1** = [caddy](https://hub.docker.com/r/abiosoft/caddy/)
- **who2** = [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/)
- **who3** = [whoami](https://hub.docker.com/r/emilevauge/whoami/) by Émile Vauge
- **who4** = [whoami](https://hub.docker.com/r/emilevauge/whoami/)

## Why it there an error 404 when I click on 80

For this demo it's normal. It's because there is no real domain that points to the address generated by play-with-ghost. Look at the flag host `- "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:mydummysite.com"` in the docker-compose named toolweb.yml

Also, in production you would point you domain name to the IP of your host.

## Commands

Just execute:

- `./_up`
- `./_down`
- `./_restart` (typical flow when I debug)

This is all I got! Hope you enjoyed this!

## DEV vs PROD

This is **NOT prod ready**

I use my own custom `traefik-private.toml` (that I keep outside of this repo) and overide `traefik.toml` file just after I cloned the repo. You could go fancy and do some sed' stuff as well.

## Final word

Looking to **kickstart you website** (static page page + a CMS) ? Take a look at [play-with-ghost](http://play-with-ghost.com/) (another project I shared). It allows you to see and edit websites made with Ghost. In short, you can try Ghost on the spot without having to sign-up!

#### P.S.

If you have solid skills 🤓 with Docker Swarm, Linux bash and the gang and yo’re looking to help a startup to launch a solid project, I would love to get to know you. Buzz me 👋 on Twitter [@askpascalandy](https://twitter.com/askpascalandy). You can see the things that are done and the things we have to do [here](http://firepress.org/en/technical-challenges-we-are-facing-now/).

I’m looking for bright and caring people to join this [journey](http://firepress.org/en/tag/from-the-heart/) with me.
