## Golf R MK75 6MT 2018

- 20 000KM
- Manual 6 speed (6MT)
- Engine 2.0 TSI EA888 GEN3 engine
- Dynamic Chassis Control (DCC)
- Stock Power: 292 hp | 217.7 kW | 296 PS

### In the future I want

My plan is to go for a Stage 3 with the EQT Vortex XL. I feel around 470whp would make sense with the **stock block motor** to be safe.

- Reliability is key on **stock block motor**
- 470 bhp (EQT's FAQ 420-470whp)
- Street only and a well-rounded behaviour
- It's my summer car (no Canadian winter for that car)
- Some of the burbles & very occasional pops (bonus)

### My STG2 tuning at the moment:

- Stg2 Unitronic tune since 12 000 KM (about 390bhp)
- Downpipe catted, CTS turbo
- Intake, Intake IE V2
- Inlet, CTS turbo

### Fuel pump

- 91 OCT at the pump, Shell, Quebec Canada
- No ethanol is available here. I'm not into competition and ethanol mixes. I don't want to mix myself, this car is a daily. As I live in Quebec Canada, the best we can get around here is 91 OCT from Shell. Yes Petro Canada offers 94 OCT but many Clubsport folks had issues with their car performing poorly. It's random really... We suspect that water can accumulate in the gas station tanks with our weather conditions (-40 to +40 Celcius).

### EQT Vortex XL / Big Turbo

- Vortex XL: Pump: 420-470whp. From FAQ: <https://www.eqtuning.com/apps/help-center#hc-what-kind-of-power-output-is-expected-from-your-tunes>
- Actuator installed and calibrated
- EQT High Flow Discharge Kit (save 75$)

### Discharge Pipe + Turbo Muffler Delete

Included 275$ / <https://eqtuning.com/collections/vw-audi/products/eqt-mqb-2-5-discharge-pipe-turbo-muffler-delete>

**ED** : Pascal Andy with the Vortex XL on 94, we can usually do around 480whp. I have a couple cars trapping around 127mph on that setup. This can be done with just hpfp and lpfp. But MPI is better.

**ED** : The XL still makes a solid 60-70whp over an IS38 on straight pump gas. If you can’t feel that, you need your butt dyno recalibrated 😉. Of course E85 will pick up a lot as well.

**ED** : Mario Flores 480hp with intake and tune is 100% bullshit. But I have plenty of cars including my own running 500whp+ on stock engines.

**ED** : Downpipe, Intercooler, Intake, HPFP, spark plugs. We can offer e-tuning via Cobb or you can use a tuner of your choice. If you have a DSG you will need a DSG tune. If you have a manual, you'll definitely need a clutch as well. For 400hp you don't need E85.

**ED** : Our muffler delete and discharge pipe are 2.5” ID. The stock pipe necks down to about 1.6”. With the upgraded turbo, I highly recommend our setup or others with similar size like Neuspeed. When the turbo is pushed hard, you would see a roughly 10-15whp gain going from the stock pipe. Definitely a recommended upgrade for stock mounts. I have quite a few tricks up my sleeve for the stock fuel system on these cars :)

Best route is going to be a brushless LPFP + MPI from A2B imo. The brushless LPFP comes preinstalled in the basket which makes it MUCH easier to install PLUS it comes with a built in controller which means you won’t need a PM4 Torqbyte. Brushless pumps flow more and are more efficient, will be all the fuel you need. They also sell it with an MPI kit, ethanol sensor and new fuel lines. This plus the turbo and your ready to go! EQT does a huge annual winter “boost weather” sale so I highly recommend getting the turbo during that time. You’ll save like $300+ on turbo and tuning.

### MPI Multi port injection kit (with LPFP)

- 1750$ <https://www.a2bmotorsport.net/17/0/0/320/a2b-hybrid-fueling-a2b-motorsport-ultimate-hybrid-fueling-kit.html>
- ALT 850$ / 925cc <https://eqtuning.com/collections/vw-audi/products/precision-raceworks-mpi-kit-vw-audi-mqb>
- ALT: MPI Multi PORT INJECTION KIT / CTS TURBO MK7 VW/AUDI EA888 GEN 3
- Pascal if you want to run MPI you just need a LPFP with it, no HPFP is needed. Usually you would also need a PM4 Fuel Controller BUT you can get a brushless LPFP with a controller built in which is even better because it is more efficient and better flowing than vs a standard pump. I recommend this MPI and Brushless LPFP kit from A2B.

### Low pressure fuel pump LPFP

- 1900$ ALT KIT - <https://www.a2bmotorsport.net/17/0/0/320/a2b-hybrid-fueling-a2b-motorsport-ultimate-hybrid-fueling-kit.html#PhotoSwipe1601038785200>
