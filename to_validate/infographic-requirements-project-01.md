Hi Soufiane,

Thank you again for our last call! As I was saying, this is what I’m looking for.

### The mood for this first project

- Male hair dresser
- His name is Martin Foglia
- He is between 32-40 years old
- He is a freelancer

* * *

These are the deliverables I need:

### 1) Header banner (background)

- **Output** : `martin-foglia-header-main.jpg`
- example:
- <http://martinenadal.tk/news/services/> (without the logo!)
- the header of this page
- size: 1400px by 786px (ratio: 16/9)
- 100% quality

### 2) Logo with font of the brand +

- **Output** : `martin-foglia-logo-light.png`
- **Output** : `martin-foglia-logo-dark.png`
- 100% quality with transparency
- ratio: you decide. I prefer something between a square and a 16/9 ratio
- size | width = 1000px
- 100% quality

_I will add the logo over the header banner myself._

### 3) Icon with NO font or anything written

- **Output** : `martin-foglia-icon-light.png`
- **Output** : `martin-foglia-icon-dark.png`
- size and ratio: 500px by 500px
- 100% quality with transparency

### 4) Pictures

- 5 pictures that fits together for this persona
- Just imagine that a photographer did a photo shoot for Martin Foglia. He took 5 pictures to show the ambience of Martin's business. This is a classic shooting for a small business.
- It needs to look like a real website, not like corporate stock images. My market audience are small businesses

- **Output** : `martin-foglia-ambiance-3.jpg`

Can't wait to see what you can do :)
