Good morning Gladiators!

- Please look at what I prepared for you tomorrow:
**GHOST_URL** /10-stages-of-the-lifecycle-of-a-business/
- Starting at 8h30, duration 60 min

### 1) Chit-chat

- 5-10 min

### 2) DCA

Communicate out loud your DCA like a president would do it during the final stretch of his/her campaign. Make us believers!!

**We will expect to hear:**

- confidence
- vulnerability
- conviction
- passion

### 3) Assess in which cycle your business is at the moment.

- What needs to happen for your business to move on the next level ?
- See image below for context.

### 4) Ask me for help

Ask for his/her wisdom carefully.

- Your partner will give you 30-60 min of his precious attention.
- Will be done outside this meeting but before our next meeting.

_requester / helper_

- Jill > Luz

- Denis > Pascal
- Pascal > Jill

### 5) Go with the flow
