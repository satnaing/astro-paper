## Directions

1. Here how to reach **my place** > watch at 10m43.

2. You can also use [Uber](https://www.uber.com/invite/50ba9) (Taxi) from the **train station** to my place. It's a 15-20 min ride. Here is the [map](https://www.google.ca/maps/dir/''/station+train+Lucien+L'Allier/data=!4m5!4m4!1m0!1m2!1m1!1s0x4cc91a6870a1d865:0x597fdbe62415076?sa=X&ei=XmRRVYivKsjwsAX84oDQAg&ved=0CIgBEPUXMA8).

3. The **subway station Verdun** is at 20 min of walk from my place. Here is the [map](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/station+verdun/@45.459222,-73.571833,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xe1dfca58a69a8bec?sa=X&ei=5ntSVdnUKYO3yATKiYDgCg&ved=0CH4Q_BIwDQ). Many busses are at at less than 1 min from my place but I still recommand using [Uber](https://www.uber.com/invite/50ba9) to travel around :)

4. For the **parking** , you'll find place. Just look at the sign carefully!

## Check in/out

- **Check-in** \- 4h00PM (exception for Praveen, 9h00AM)
- **Check-out** \- 11h00AM
- **Key exchange** \- In person. Let me know if you can not arrive at our place at this EXACT time.

## Item in the kitchen

If I can save you a trip to the grocery store it’s cool with me :) So all I’m asking, is having you to tell me what you took and leave money on the table.

## No cleaning fees but ...

To keep costs down, I do not charge for any cleaning fees. Therefore, when you will check out, the property must be clean, **EXACTLY LIKE WHEN YOU ARRIVED**.

Specifically, it is expected that:

1. Sheets and towels must be removed from the beds and left in the wash machine. **Don’t have to wash them! I’ll take care of this :)**

2. Toilet and shower must also be cleaned

3. Use vacuum to clean floors and mop if necessary

4. All dishes must be put back where they were, counters and table wiped down

If one or many points are neglected, I reserve the right **to keep 60$ of the deposit**. Hopefully, I will not have to use this security deposit :)

## ✌ Common sense rules ✌

- One room is locked and obviously you should not try to go there.
- We do not accept pets
- No smoking
- Please remove your shoes when you get in the house
- No loud music, it's an apartment, not a house
- Please remember that this is our place, not a hotel. We live in a quiet area. Respect the neighbourhood.
- Dancing, laughing is allowed :)

## Let's improve

> I wise man once said : « Strive for continuous improvement, instead of perfection. »

Maybe I forgot something. Maybe I did not mention a detail or something, So, if your feel something is not cool, please call me first. I want to make things rights for everyone. I’ll do my best to make it perfect for you and my future guests. Thanks for contributing :)
