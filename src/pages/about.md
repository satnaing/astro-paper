# Hola! 👋

I’m **Prithvi Poreddy** — equal parts builder, observer, and writer.  
My curiosity lives at the edges where **technology, behavior, and structure** meet.  
Some days that means designing identity systems or thinking about AI governance; other days, it’s economics, markets, or a late-night thought about Saturn’s rings.

I’ve spent years leading in identity and security, but the work has always been about something bigger: understanding **how systems hold together — and why they fail**.  
The same principles echo in finance, governance, software, and philosophy.  
When I find overlaps, I like to pause and re-explore them.

## Why This Space Exists

Most of my writing used to stay private — buried in design docs, architecture decks, and long internal threads.  
This site is my way of moving slower and thinking out loud.  

It isn’t meant to be polished; it’s meant to be honest.  
I write to connect dots, to understand ideas across disciplines, and to see what patterns repeat themselves when the context changes.

I wanted a place to:

1. **Own my content** — beyond algorithms and fleeting feeds  
2. **Go deeper** — follow a thread until it hits bedrock  
3. **Document my thinking** — to learn from earlier versions of myself  
4. **Explore intersections** — where identity meets AI, or economics meets philosophy

## What I Explore

**Identity & Systems**  
Identity is a framework I return to often — not because it defines everything, but because it reveals how we define *anything*.  
It’s a practical lens for understanding trust, accountability, and structure.

**Artificial Intelligence**  
AI raises new questions about agency and governance.  
I’m drawn to its design challenges and its human implications — not just how models work, but how we decide what “working” means.

**Systems & Architecture**  
I’m fascinated by the trade-offs that make large systems resilient or brittle.  
Every design decision is a small bet on what we think will remain true.

**Economics & Finance**  
Markets are the purest form of feedback loops.  
They teach risk, incentives, and the uncomfortable symmetry between freedom and consequence.

**Astronomy & Philosophy**  
These are my reminders of scale and stillness.  
Astronomy grounds me in perspective; philosophy helps me choose direction.  
Together, they keep everything else in proportion.

### What You’ll Find Here

Notes, essays, and small experiments — sometimes technical, sometimes reflective.  
You might see code beside philosophy, or an identity model next to a musing on incentives.  
That mix is the point.

If there’s a single thread connecting it all, it’s curiosity — the need to understand *how things connect, adapt, and endure*.
