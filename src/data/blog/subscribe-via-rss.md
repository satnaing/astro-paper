## What is RSS?

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed that allows you to receive updates from websites in a standardized format. Instead of visiting multiple sites to check for new content, RSS brings the content to you.

## How to Subscribe

1. **Copy the RSS feed URL**: [/rss.xml](/rss.xml)
2. **Add it to your favorite RSS reader**
