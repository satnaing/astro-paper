First read ALL of the AGENTS dot md file and README dot md file super carefully and understand ALL of both! Then use your code investigation agent mode to fully understand the code, and technical architecture and purpose of the project. 

Then, once you've done an extremely thorough and meticulous job at all that and deeply understood the entire existing system and what it does, its purpose, and how it is implemented and how all the pieces connect with each other, I need you to hyper-intensively investigate and study and ruminate on these questions as they pertain to this project.
